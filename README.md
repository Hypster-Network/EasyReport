# EasyReport
Turp's Easy &amp; Simple Report Plugin (EasyReport) is a plugin made to easily report players with the /report &lt;player> &lt;reason> command. <br />It also contains a bunch of other useful optional features like database and Discord webhook integration.

**This is the official repository for the EasyReport plugin.**  
Feel free to contribute if you want to! :)

## Future updates:
- The staff can open a private chat with a player about their report up to 30 seconds after they receive the report alert.  
After that the player gets an automatically message explaining to them that a staff member just opened a private chat with
them about their latest report and if they want to leave they can type /report leave.  
From then on all the following messages the player sends go straight to the private chat until either the staff member who opened
the chat decides to close it or the player leaves the chat.  

- Add extra query options to /report records (e.g. get all reports from a specific date).  

- Store the IP of the players reported in the database and include it in the Discord webhook report message.
